>> Program main starts from : runner.py
>> Structure of Code in runner.py
    - ask_for_odrer : asks input for the order
    - generate_plan : The algorithm is written in planner.py which calls:
        find_plan (finds a solution, if its there) and then, 
        execute_plan (it calls allthe callbacks, if there is a plan)
>> Note: python3 is being used, I have also added the Shebang line for this.
